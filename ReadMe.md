Where I write stuff.

## Setup

A lot of these posts contain code samples. 

Some of them will rely upon [jasm](https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/CodeTools/asmtools) for assembling JVM class files.
A precompiled binary is provided in the root directory of this project.
To compile a .jasm file use `java -jar asmtools.jar jasm file.jasm`.
